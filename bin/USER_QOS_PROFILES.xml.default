Description
An RTI Connext QoS Profile that provides strictly
reliable communication. It is not tuned for maximum throughput - see
high_throughput.xml for a more aggressive configuration - but provides a
reasonable balance between latency and throughput for a variety of
applications.

Strict reliability depends primarily on:

Data writer:
  - reliability: RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS to enable heartbeating
  - history: KEEP_ALL_HISTORY_QOS
             to prevent the writer from overwriting unacknowledged samples
             with new data

Data reader:
  - reliability: RELIABLE_RELIABILITY_QOS to enable acknowledgements
  - history: KEEP_ALL_HISTORY_QOS
             to prevent the reader from overwriting undelivered samples
             with new data

Domain participant:
  - Increased transport buffer sizes to efficiently send and receive many
    large packets

                    Finite resources are not required for strict reliability.
                    However, by limiting how far "ahead" of its readers a

                        it will send a repair packet to that reader.

                        The amount of time the writer waits between receiving
                        the NACK and sending the repair will be a random

                        towards zero, will make the writer more reactive.
                        However, by leaving some delay, you increase the
                        chances that the writer will learn of additional
                        readers that missed the same data, in which case it
